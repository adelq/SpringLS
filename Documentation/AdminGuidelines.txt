# Lobby moderator guidelines

* Do not use `/chanmsg` unless really neccessary

	Channel messages are primarly used for various channel and server notifications.
	Greeting your friends with `/chanmsg` is an example of bad usage.

* Do not use `/ban` unless absolutely neccessary

	Since banning a player means he can not play the game anymore.
	You should always have a good reason to use it,
	but before using it, you should always try to resolve the situation first
	by warning the player or by using the `/kick` command,
	so that the player gets the message.

* It is recommended that you do not discuss your decisions publicly too much

	Since moderating is not a democracy, and moderators should retain
	some authority.
	It does not matter whether players agree with your decisions or not.

* Players should be warned (or muted) if flaming

	bad:

	* being disrespectful towards other players
	* using inappropriate vocabulary

	ok:

	* talking in UPPER CASE
	* repeating a message in the main channel (unless it actually becomes spamming)

Other rules are not fixed, instead some common sense should be applied when moderating.
